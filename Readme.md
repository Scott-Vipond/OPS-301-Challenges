# OPS-301-Challenges
OPS-301 Challenges

## Inputs:

This repo (OPS-301-Challenges) was created for the Code Fellows Ops and Cybersecurity OPS 301 class.  We had daily code challenges to stretch our experience in coding and provide some initial exposure to that aspect of IT.

The skills we practiced will enable automation of tasks if needed in future system administrative positions such as installing new desktop computer remotely, activating group policies, or ensure security features are updated and turned on.  Additionally, we become familiar with reading code to identify variables, loops, functions, etc. in Bash and Powershell.

With the start of OPS-301, we added Python to our toolkit of languages.
